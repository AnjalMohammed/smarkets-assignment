## Instructions to start dev server

1. You have to disable CORS validation on your browser for the APIs to come through (you can use extensions or run the following command (for Mac)).

  `open -n -a /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --args --user-data-dir="/tmp/chrome_dev_test" --disable-web-security`

2. after cloning the repo run `npm install` to get all the dependencies into your machine.

3. run `npm start` and your server should come up at the next available port (probably 3000)
